# Fuel-Economy-Analysis
Capstone Project analyzing and testing hypotheses regarding automotive fuel economy in the USA

This project aims to find correlations and trends in fuel economy data for vehicles in the USA. 
This project was entirely self-driven, in that the raw dataset was provided but all avenues of discovery and analysis are my own.
The workbook is not locked or organized for presentational purposes; it functions as an exploration as the data and a deep dive in to the statistics involved.
This project made heavy use of the Excel Data Analysis add on.
The data involved required some cleaning and organizing. You can see the original raw data here: https://www.kaggle.com/epa/fuel-economy/version/1
